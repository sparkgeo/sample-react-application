# Template React App

This is a syntenthesis of best practices when building a new React App in Sparkgeo.

This template is meant for single-page applications (SPAs), as well as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). If you are looking for Server Side Rendered applications or Static Site Generator, this is not a starter repo you want at all.

## Component and Library Layout

### Directories

Each of these directories are of a single depth.

| Directory    | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `components` | All visual components                               |
| `helpers`    | Immutable JS functions                              |
| `lib`        | All JS tools that aren't immutable helper functions |


### Special Config Files

| File Name         | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| theme.js          | Theme information for grommet and styled components |
| App.css           | All CSS for all core DOM elements                   |
| .eslintrc         | Instructions for linting rules                      |
| .eslintignore     | Where to ignore the linting rules entirely          |
| .prettierrc       | Configuration instructions for autoformat rules     |
| .serviceWorker.js | Autogenerated file by CRA that assists with PWAs    |

## Styling

- App.css for global rules of HTML elements
    - 1rem = 10px by default
- [Grommet](https://https://v2.grommet.io) for abstract primitives (Box, Form, FormField, etc)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styling at the component-level.

## Testing

TBD - Jest for Unit Tests and Integration; Cypress for E2E



## Linting and Code Formatting

Linting is based on a subset of AirBNB's style guide and internal best practices.
