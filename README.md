# Template React App

This is a syntenthesis of best practices when building a new React App in Sparkgeo.

This template is meant for single-page applications (SPA's). If you are looking for Server Side Rendered applications or Static Site Generator, this is not a starter repo you want at all.


# Explainers

## Component and Library Layout

TBD

## Styling

- App.css for global rules of HTML elements
    - 1rem = 10px by default
- [Grommet](https://https://v2.grommet.io) for abstract primitives (Box, Form, FormField, etc)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styling at the component-level.

## Testing

TBD - Jest for Unit Tests and Integration; Cypress for E2E

## Linting and Code Formatting

Linting is based on a subset of AirBNB's style guide and internal best practices.
